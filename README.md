Single-cell profiling of tumor heterogeneity and the microenvironment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer

Introduction:

“There are two primary types of lung cancer, known as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Named initially for how the cancer cells look under the microscope, these two account for 230,000 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer in the U.S. each year. The vast majority (85 percent) of lung cancers fall into the category called non-small cell lung cancer. Though this form of lung cancer progresses more slowly than SCLC, 40 percent of NSCLCs will have spread beyond the lungs by the time it is diagnosed.”

Lung cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease. Cancer cells and cells within the tumor microenvironment together determine disease progression, as well as response to or escape from treatment. To map the cell type-specific transcriptome landscape of cancer cells and their tumor microenvironment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyze 42 tissue biopsy samples from stage III/IV NSCLC patients by single cell RNA sequencing and present the large scale, single cell resolution profiles of advanced NSCLCs. In addition to cell types described in previous single cell studies of early stage lung cancer, we are able to identify rare cell types in tumors such as follicular dendritic cells and T helper 17 cells. Tumors from different patients display large heterogeneity in cellular composition, chro- mosomal structure, developmental trajectory, intercellular signaling network and phenotype dominance. Our study also reveals a correlation of tumor heterogeneity with tumor asso- ciated neutrophils, which might help to shed light on their function in NSCLC.

42 Samples were collected by diagnostic procedures including transcutaneous needle biopsy, bronchoscopy or superficial lymph node biopsy for scRNA_seq (HiSeq X Ten, Homo sapiens)

Project Objectives:
Objective 1: Compare cancer vs. non-cancer cells in samples (using differential expression)
Objective 2: Determine 11 major cell types through manual and automated annotation
Objective 3: Select immune cells and categorize them by type
